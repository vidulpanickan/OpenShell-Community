# NemoClaw Community

[NemoClaw](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NemoClaw) is the runtime environment for autonomous agents -- the infrastructure where they live, work, and verify. It provides a programmable factory where agents can spin up physics simulations to master tasks, generate synthetic data to fix edge cases, and safely iterate through thousands of failures in isolated sandboxes. The core engine includes the sandbox runtime, policy engine, gateway (with k3s harness), privacy router, and CLI.

This repo is the community ecosystem around NemoClaw -- a hub for contributed skills, sandbox images, launchables, and integrations that extend its capabilities. For the core engine, docs, and published artifacts (PyPI, containers, binaries), see the [NemoClaw](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NemoClaw) repo.

## What's Here

| Directory | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `brev/` | [Brev](https://brev.dev) launchable for one-click cloud deployment of NemoClaw |
| `sandboxes/` | Pre-built sandbox images for domain-specific workloads (each with its own skills) |

### Sandboxes

| Sandbox | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `sandboxes/sdg/` | Synthetic data generation workflows |
| `sandboxes/openclaw/` | OpenClaw -- open agent manipulation and control |
| `sandboxes/simulation/` | General-purpose simulation sandboxes |

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [NemoClaw CLI](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NemoClaw) installed (`uv pip install nemoclaw`)
- Docker or a compatible container runtime
- NVIDIA GPU with appropriate drivers (for GPU-accelerated images)

### Quick Start with Brev

The fastest way to get up and running is with the included Brev launchable:

<!-- TODO: Add Brev launchable instructions -->

### Using Sandboxes

```bash
nemoclaw sandbox create --image openclaw
```

The `--image` flag accepts any of the sandbox images defined under `sandboxes/` (e.g., `sdg`, `cosmos`, `openclaw`, `simulation`).
